    "### What is a Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a  template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a cookie cutter and objects as the cookies made from it. Each cookie (object) has the same shape (structure) but can have different decorations (attribute values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of a Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attributes (Properties/Fields)**: Variables that belong to the class. They represent the state or characteristics of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constructor (`__init__`)**: A special method that is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors or actions that objects can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instances (Objects)**: Individual objects created from a class. Each instance can have different attribute values but shares the same methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance of a class, you're creating a specific object with its own unique data. The process is called **instantiation**.\n",

    "## 3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is a mechanism that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent Class (Base/Super Class)**: The class being inherited from\n",
    "- **Child Class (Derived/Sub Class)**: The class that inherits from the parent\n",
    "- The child class inherits all attributes and methods from the parent\n",
    "- The child class can:\n",
    "  - Add new attributes and methods\n",
    "  - Override parent methods (method overriding)\n",
    "  - **Extending parent methods with `super`**: In a child class, you can call the parent's implementation of a method using `super().method()`, then add extra functionality before or after it. This allows you to reuse the parent's logic while customizing behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    # parent class body\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # child class body\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Inheritance:\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Avoid writing duplicate code\n",
    "2. **Extensibility**: Easily extend existing code\n",
    "3. **Maintainability**: Changes in parent class automatically reflect in child classes\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Classification**: Models real-world relationships"

    "### When to Create a Constructor in Child Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a constructor (`__init__`) in the child class in **TWO situations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Adding New Attributes\n",
    "When your child class needs additional attributes beyond what the parent provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Modifying How Parent Attributes Are Initialized\n",
    "When you want to change how the parent's attributes are set up (e.g., providing default values, validating input, or computing values before passing to parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If your child class doesn't add new attributes or modify initialization logic, you **DON'T need** a constructor. The parent's constructor will be used automatically."

This is useful when you want to:\n1. **Extend** the parent's behavior (add to it, not replace it)\n2. **Call the parent's constructor** to initialize inherited attributes\n3. **Reuse** parent logic while adding custom functionality",

Polymorphism\n\n### What is Polymorphism?\n\n**Polymorphism** (from Greek: \"many forms\") is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique way.\n\n**Key Concept**: \"Same method name, different behavior\"\n\n### How Polymorphism Works:\n\nWhen you call a method on an object, Python uses the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to find which version of the method to execute:\n1. Checks the object's class first\n2. If found, executes that version\n3. If not found, checks parent classes\n\nThis allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different implementations.\n\n### Types of Polymorphism:\n\n1. **Method Overriding**: Child classes provide their own implementation of parent class methods\n2. **Duck Typing**: \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck\" - Python doesn't require explicit inheritance\n\n### Benefits:\n- **Flexibility**: Write code that works with different object types\n- **Extensibility**: Add new classes without changing existing code\n- **Simplification**: Use a common interface for different implementations",

Method Resolution Order (MRO)**\n- Python searches: Child → Parent → Grandparent → ...\n- Use `super()` to call parent methods\n- Check with `ClassName.__mro__`\n\n**4. Method Overriding**\n- Child class replaces parent's method\n- Use `super()` to extend (not replace) parent's method\n\n**5.
