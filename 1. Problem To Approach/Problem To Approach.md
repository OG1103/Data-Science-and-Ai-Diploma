# Problem To Approach Abstract

## 1. Understanding Business Domain
Understand the business problem you're solving and what success looks like. Learn how the business operates, its technical aspects, and domain-specific knowledge to fully grasp the problem. Know who needs this solution and how it creates value for the business.

## 2. Data Requirements and Understanding (Very Important)
Understand what type of data you'll need and work with, what it represents, the expected volume, features, and what you want the data to show. It's very important to understand the data that you will work with. In this step it's external undertstanding since i don't have the actual data. (description of the data, what the features represent and so on ; basically an overview) 

## 3. Data Collection
Gather data from available sources (databases, APIs, files) or create simulations when real data isn't available. 

## 4. Data Preperation
After gathering data, we begin to depthen our understanding by performing some data anaylsis and find patterns within our data (understanding our data internally). With that we start detecting anomlies or flaws and we then start to clean the data and process it based on our findings & understading of the data  Once it's processed, it's then ready for modelling. 

## 5. Modelling
Pass our data to the model and we start training our model in order to solve our problem based on the data we passed to it 

## 6. Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our model based on some metrics to see if it's good or not. (If not good we go and fine tune our model to optimize it back to step 5). 

## 7. Deployment 
Our model is good to go and good enough (we chose our best model based on step 6) so we deploy it to production for it to be used by the public

## 8. Predict & Feedback 
Once our model is deployed we can you use to make predictions and after some time we gather feedback and see if our model is not performing as expected to we go back to step 5 (Modelling) in order to optimize it.
